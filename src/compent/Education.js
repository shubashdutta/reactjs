      only 2.46% of the 2021-22 Union Budget was allocated to their development and welfare. In fact, the National Plan of Action for Children recommends that budgetary allocations for children should be 5% of the countryâ€™s GDP â€“ ours has been stagnant at 0.43% of GDP for the last two years.

        <h2 >Importance of Child Rights</h2>
        <p>According to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), which

          was ratified by India in 1992, all children have fundamental rights which must be

          recognized by governments and citizens alike. At SAI BABA TURST, weâ€™re committed to doing.

          everything we can to ensure the rights of Indiaâ€™s children and so, work on 4 key

          programmatic areas.</p>

          <p>Education is a basic human right that works to raise men and women out of poverty, level inequalities and ensure sustainable development. But worldwide 244 million children and youth are still out of school for social, economic and cultural reasons. Education is one of the most powerful tools in lifting excluded children and adults out of poverty and is a stepping stone to other fundamental human rights. It is the most sustainable investment. The right to quality education is already firmly rooted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international legal instruments, the majority of which are the result of the work of UNESCO and the United Nations...</p>

          <p>According to data available at that time, India had an estimated 30-40 million out-of-school children, which is a concerning number. However, please note that these figures may have changed over time due to various factors such as government initiatives, changes in policies, and the impact of the pandemic.

            For the most current and accurate data, I recommend referring to the latest reports from reputable sources like the Ministry of Education (formerly Ministry of Human Resource Development), UNESCO, or other relevant educational authorities in India.....</p>
